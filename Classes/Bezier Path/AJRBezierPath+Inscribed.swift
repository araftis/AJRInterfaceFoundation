     Takes in an array of intersection rects and modify them as appropriate.

     This mehod basically entails making sure that no rectangles overlap with any other rectangles. When rectangles overlap, the following happens:

     1. If the rectangles don't overlap any other rectangles, then the rectangles are left alone.
     2. If the one rectangle is fully contained by other rectangle, it's removed.
     3. If the rectangles overlap, but don't intersect, then we split the rectangles and selectively remove the rectangles that no longer matter.

     Note that this isn't necessarily super efficient, but since we should only ever be dealing with a relatively small number of rectangles, we're not going to worry too much about complex optimizations. We can revisit that decision if we find that we're spending a lot of time in this method.
