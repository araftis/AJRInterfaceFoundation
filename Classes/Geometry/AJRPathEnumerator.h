 Initializes an enumerator with the provided path.

 Note that the error value used to flatten bezier segments will be taken from the path at this point. It's important to note that if you're enumerating a path that will be displayed at a scale other than 1, you may need to adjust the error value on the enumerator.

 When enumerating a path, you can enumerate the actual segments, or you can enumerate by just line segments, which effectively flattens all bezier path segments in the input path. Which type of enumeration is controlled by call -nextLineSegmentIsNewSubpath: or -nextElementWithPoints:. You should only call one of these methods, as alternating calls between these methods can cause undefined results.

 Returns the next line segment in the path. Calling this method will flatten any bezier path segments in the path. When calling this, you can pass in a pointer to a boolean, `isNewSubpath`, which will be initialized if the line segment represents the first line segment in a new subpath. This will always return YES at least once for each path, but can be YES for multiple. If you don't care about this, you may pass `NULL`.

 @param isNewSubpath An option pointer to a boolean that will be initialized to YES if the returned line segment represents the first line segment of a new subpath.

 @results The next line segment in the path, or NULL if there are no more line segments.

/*!
 Returns the next segment of path, and it's corresponding points.

 The number of points returned will vary between 0 and 3 depending on the type of element returned. So, an `AJRBezierPathElementClose`  will have no associated points, while `AJRBezierPathElementMoveTo` and `AJRBezierPathElementLineTo` will have 1 point returned, and `AJRBezierPathElementCubicCurveTo` will return 3 points. As such, `points` should be large enough to hold three points.

 @param points A pointer to an array of CGPoint. This should be large enough to hold three points.

 @result The type of the next element or NULL if there are no more elements in the path.
